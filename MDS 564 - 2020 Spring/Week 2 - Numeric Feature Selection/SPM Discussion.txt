For this exercise, I focused on running the caravan customer profile data through the TreeNets model builder using SPM. I researched a bit on what the dependency plots in SPM represent. I found a blog, Reading TreeNet Partial Dependency Plots by Dan Steinberg, that described what partial dependency plots are. My understanding of these plots are a representation of how the model has indicated or predicted how the target variable changes as a result of changes in the predictor variable. The method SPM uses allows us to gather the interaction between a single variable and the predictor variable and hold all others constant to get a good look at the effects of a single variable to the target.

For example, it appears the MOSTYPE (Customer Type) was the variable with the most variable importance according to this model. Note: I set the learning to param to .1 instead of Auto as suggested by a training video. Looking at the dependency plot, it suggests that the MOSTYPE of 3 (High Status Seniors), 8 (Middle class families), and 12 (Affluent Young families) all have an output around .3 while 40 (Large family farms) and 41 (Mixed rurals) are at a -.2. While non of the outputs are highly suggestive one way or another, it gives us an indication that the positive outputs suggest a higher likilihood that the observation represents a caravan insurance holder while the negative ones suggest the opposite.

When comparing the ROC graph from the logistic regression from the text last week, the TreeNets seemed to do very similar. Both seem to flatten out at a true positive rate of .8 and false positive rate of .5.
