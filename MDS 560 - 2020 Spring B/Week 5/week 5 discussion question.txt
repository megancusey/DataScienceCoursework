During class we discussed the potential for deploying models into "production " environments. This could occur in a variety of ways such as by installing code into custom applications (example PRIMMS), into office products such as Excel or by embedding models in web services for internet users.

Question 2 of your accelerator assignment for week 5 asks you to use the "Production Dataset" to accompany dataset 4 to demonstrate how a model could be deployed to production to help sales order entry staff quote more accurate lead times (i.e. delivery dates) to customers. Describe your approach  for accomplishing this using the X variable "Throughput" and describe how additional enhancements could be added to the approach to continually improve customer satisfaction.

Share your thoughts with all of us on how you would build and deploy a model (based upon dataset 4 information) that would enable sales order entry people to quote more accurate delivery dates to customers. How might this work as a business process? What enterprise KPIs would likely improve as a result?
