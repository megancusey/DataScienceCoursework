Chapter 10:
1. The mean grade in a class on a final exam is a parameter when the mean includes data from the entire grade or population. It is considered a statistic if the mean was taken from a sample of the grade.
2. An estimator is bias when it over estimates or under estimates the parameter. The mean of the smapling distribution is the expected value. If an estimator equals the expected value, it is unbiased. If it does not equal the expected value, it is biased.

r =.55 = Z' = .618
N = 28
standard error = 1/sqrt(28-3) = .2
LL(z') = .288
UP(z') = 1.072
LL(r) = .280
UL(r) = .79
Since less than .35 is included in the 95% confidence interval, I would not want to use the test to screen job applicants.

p = .64
s(p) = sqrt((.64(1-.64))/25) = .096
LL .64 - (1.96)(.096) -.02 = .43
UL .64 + (1.96)(.096) +.02 = .85 
The 95% confidence interal is (43, .85)
24.(-.61,2.61) ???
25.(-0.81,2.81) ???
