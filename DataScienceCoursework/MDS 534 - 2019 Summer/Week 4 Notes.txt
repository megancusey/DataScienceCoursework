Market Basket Analysis
4 groups of data
- Stores
- Customers
- Orders
- Items

Step 1 - Do basic measurements to identify interesting charasterics of the data

Step 2 - Ask a business question.
Doesn't have to be at the transactional level. Can be summarized information such as one row per product for a week. Can describe the customer etc.

Step 3 - Identify data required & attributes. Separate into bins. Can use the exclude middle approach like the Hispanic - Non-Hispanic approach excluded Mixed catchment areas and focused on Highly Hispanic and Non-Hispanic regions.

Step 4 - Visualize and Build Association Rules

Data:
Transaction data table
co-occurance table, counts how many times items appear together
contingency table - used with chi square, counts number of times of combinations of when right/left hand sides on the association rule is present or absent in the other side
use another measure such as lift to determine if the absent or present rule is better

Types of Association Rules
- Actionable: Rules that contain high quality information that can be used to support an action.
- Trivial: Rules that are common knowledge
- Inexplicable: Doesn't have an explanation or suggest an action.

Measures include support, confidence, lift, and chi-squared

Challenges of creating association rules:
- Choosing right set of items
- Generating rules by deciphering the counts in the co-occurrence matrix
- limitations of large datasets
