ETS Models are state space models that describe unobserved data by equations of how different components ( level, trend, seasonal) change over time in the observed data.

ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonal) models apply a combination of level, trend, seasonal state equations with different paramters such as using an additive or multiplicative formula for trend and/or seasonality. A damped parameter can be used for trend and seasonality. Also, different values for the smoothing parameter can be applied. As a result, an error distribution is created (the difference between the predictable and unpredictable portions of the data) compared to the observed values.

There are different methods to evaluating which ETS model should apply. For instance there is AIC, corrected AIC, and Bayesian Information Criterion.

The main functions to apply the ETS models and produce forecasts using the model is ets() and function().

Question: In lecture, Dr. Kulich discussed situations in why somebody would want to use AIC and where another metric would be best. I remember him stating that AIC is better when we need to limit errors in the model. I've been searching for a blog or something that gives more information on this theory. Is there a source somebody can provide that I can read more about this? Perhaps just a paragraph re-explaining will do?
