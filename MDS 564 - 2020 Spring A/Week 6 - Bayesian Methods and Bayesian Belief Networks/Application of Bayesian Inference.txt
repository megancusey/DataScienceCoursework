To learn more about how Bayesian Networks are applied in real world applications, I decided to give a listen to some of the speakers that presented at the Bayesia Conference.

One speaker presented a really interesting problem that they believe Bayesian Networks can solve. Dr. Musson is a pyschologist and somebody who has studied astrophysics. He works closely with NASA, Canada, and other space agencies to help design and train astronauts for space missions.

In this discussion, he starts out by talking about how they used to use Neural Networks and he was frustrated because he felt like he knew all the weights for the features. As a result, his team started to build a program to include his domain knowledge into the modeling process when they stumbled upon Bayesia lab which met their needs. He framed the problem they were trying to solve by talking about how long it would take for an astronaut to return how if he/she became ill and needed medical attention. For historic missions, the most it would take would be a few days. However, with the end goal of going to Mars, returning home could take years. After about 5 weeks into the mission, communication would be very difficult as there would be a large delay in response time. He states there's nothing holding them back going to Mars, except for one thing: How do we care for these people in space while they are years away from earth and will have such large delay times? They believe the answer to this question is by developing a model that will assist in medical diagnosis that is updateable, interpretable, and something they can validate. The challenge to the model will be including many data sources such as these astronaut's genome sequence, medical data, etc while also accounting for space related factors they are unsure of what to except. Very interesting speaker!
