This week's reading on "There's More Than One Kind of Data Scientist" was compelling. I found it a bit ironic that they wanted to defined themselves by collecting and analyzing data. How perfect! 
Data Science is kind of a scary term because you feel like you need to excel in multiple vast areas of knowledge. The truth is, you can play to your strengths. If you excel at statistics and Programming, but know the basics of Math, Machine Learning, and Business, there's a place to you. In contrast, you might be more knowledge about the Business and Machine Learning, but less in other areas. It's ok!
Similiar to any IT project, there's many roles in a Data Science project. Dr. Kulich discussed recently with us different types of Data Science related jobs that may require more knowledge than a subset of skills than others. I think that's important to keep in mind while continuing this journey of learning Data Science. Listen to your strengths, recongize your weaknesses, try your best, there's a place in Data Science here for you if your willing to put in the work.
