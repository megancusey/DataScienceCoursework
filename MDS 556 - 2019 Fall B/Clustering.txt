Examples of Clustering Techniques:
K-Means
	Short Comings:
	 *  Undirected, no good estimate of 	    target
	 *  R^2 can be small even when the 	    line appears to be a good fit 	    making the evaluation of the 	    model difficult

Guassian Mixture Models (GMM) / Expectation Maximization (EM)

Divisive Clustering 

Agglomerative Clustering

Self-Organizing Maps - a neural network approach
