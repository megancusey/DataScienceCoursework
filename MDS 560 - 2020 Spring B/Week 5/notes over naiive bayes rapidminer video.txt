Naiive Bayes takes each condition and counts the number of true/false cases. As a result, the probability can be computed of a true/false case when a condition is met.

An example in the video, which applys the method to playing golf or not, examines the outlook of a day which could be sunny, overcast, or rainy. If 2 of the 9 observations include a sunny day when golf was played, the probability of that occurring is 2/9.

The same concept is applied to other conditions and the overall probability of a true case and negative case is calculated. 

Multiplying these probabilities together result in the likelihood of the event occurring. The higher the likelihood between positive/negative cases indicate a positive or negative prediction. To convert likelihood to a probability, divide the likelihood by the sum of the likelihood scores. This is the base rule.

Naiive Bayes because the formula assumes the assumption of independent variables which isn't usually the case.
