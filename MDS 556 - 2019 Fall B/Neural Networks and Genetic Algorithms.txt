A neural network algorithm is designed to mirror how neurons in the brain work. Neurons fire after after a certain threshold level has been reached. Neural networks work similarly by receiving a limited number of features, performing one to several tasks in order to combine them into an output. This improves on other techniques because it can work with problems that can be represented in a linear or nonlinear fashion. Neural Networks do not have techniques that assist in variable selection and require the data to be transformed so that the range of values is near zero. In addition, neural networks produces a black box response that cannot explain why the outcome is what is is.

Genetic algorithms are optimization techniques that depend on the genome and a fitness function. The genome encodes the problem with a set of weights and a fitness function. Since the genome can be applied to a series of different fitness functions, a wide variety of complex problems can be addressed using this method. Three steps occur: selection, crossover, and mutation. The result is a new generation whose average fitness is greater than the original.
