The 4 clusters identified provide a vague map for Comcast to cover in improving their customer satisification. These really give them a place to start.

Honestly, the "business analyst" in me says I would spend some time plucking individual observations and reviewing what the customer meant by 1.) Fraud, 2.) Dissatisfication with Product/Performance, 3.) Dissatisfaction with Service/Personnel/Visit, and 4.) Dissatisfaction with Billing/Business Conduct.

From there, I might separate out the four clusters. I would identify the types of fraud out there. Is somebody else using their credit card to pay for services the customer isn't using? Are people posing as one of our employees and stealing from their house? etc. I might see what is the most frequently occurring type of fraud, where, and build dimensions to try to identify how to combat fraud by iteratively creating models.

I would provide a similar approach to the other clusters. Perhaps all that is really needed is a blanket solution of new policies and increased training. However, maybe there is something more going on that is much more specific that won't be identified if looking at it from a birds eye view. Perhaps a group of people are being misguided by a manager causing an increase in billing errors. An alternative theory is that a few people at a call center are having poor attitudes. Maybe an increased amount of reviewing recorded calls and coaching the staff should be required, etc. This is where I would start in analyzing the clusters and providing a recommendation to Comcast. The information the clusters themselves provide is rather general, but a good place to start.
