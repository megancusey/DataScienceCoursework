Discuss the level of accuracy that you were able to achieve using classification modeling (i.e. logistic regression) in Rapidminer with the sales data in dataset 2. How would the information gain achieved in this example be used by a sales organization in a practical way?

Both the logistic regression and linear regression classification models were able to separate the data where the client was and was not closed very well. The Logistic Regression incorrectly assigned one observation. The Linear Regression I couldn't figure out how the get the threshold to indicate a 0 or 1, but when I compared the histogram of the actual Closed Flags and the Predicted Probability of the closed flag, it looked perfectly separated at the .5 threshold. 

I believe the most valuable information a sales organization has to gain from these classification models is what makes the difference between closing the deal or not? In the linear regression model, significant predictor variables included Follow Up calls and Criteria met. Organizations can spend more time identifying potential clients who meet more of the criteria and establishing a relationship with them through a series of follow up calls. In return, they know that they are more likely to receive a continued partnership with them by making a sell.
