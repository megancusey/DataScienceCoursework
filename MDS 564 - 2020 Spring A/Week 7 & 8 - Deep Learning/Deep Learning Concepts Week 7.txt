Terminology:
Deep Learning - expands on a neural network architecture. Traditional neural network has 2-3 hidden layers while deep learning neural networks can have many more. 

Concolutional Neural Networks: Extracts features from images

QUESTION: Figure 2 on https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/deep-learning.html has x1,x2,x3 as the output of the convolution layers (if I understand it correctly). Would that be the output of each convolution layer? For example, x1 represents the image in terms of simple shapes, x2 - complex shapes, x3 - shapes that can be used to define a flower? Then each of these inputs are put into the Fully Connected Layer that will reach the activation function to decide on a classification?

Does Deep Learning algorithm decide how many layers to build? I imagine this is part of the model tuning process, but perhaps it gives you a place to start?

Deep Learning Advantages: Features are learned directly from the data, no manual feature extraction required. Scales with data (VS ML with plateaus with more data)

Deep Learning Constraints: Need a lot of labeled data and computing power. Inability to insert domain knowledge. Black Box.

Examples of Applications: 
Automative Driving - detected stop signs, traffic lights, pedestrains etc.

Aerospacce & Defense - identify objects from satellites.

Medical Research - detect cancer cells
